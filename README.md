ðŸ§  OncoVision: Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
OncoVision is an AI-powered deep learning model designed to detect and localize brain tumors from MRI scans. Built with PyTorch, it leverages a custom CNN architecture integrated with Grad-CAM visualization to highlight tumor regions and estimate tumor growth percentage.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Brain tumors pose serious diagnostic challenges due to subtle visual differences between healthy and affected brain tissues.
OncoVision aims to assist radiologists and researchers by providing:
âž¤ Accurate tumor classification (Tumor / Healthy)
âž¤ Visual explanation using Grad-CAM heatmaps
âž¤ Tumor growth estimation percentage based on image analysis
âž¤ This project bridges deep learning and medical imaging to support early and transparent diagnosis.

ðŸ§© Key Features
âž¤ Binary Classification: Detects if a brain MRI shows a tumor or is healthy.
âž¤ Grad-CAM Visualization: Highlights the specific region where the tumor is detected.
âž¤ Tumor Growth Estimation: Calculates approximate tumor spread percentage.
âž¤ Custom CNN Architecture: Lightweight yet accurate convolutional neural network.
âž¤ Model Training Pipeline: Easily trainable and extendable for medical datasets.

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The model uses a Custom CNN with the following components:
âž¤ Convolutional + ReLU + MaxPooling layers for feature extraction
âž¤ Fully connected dense layers for classification
âž¤ Softmax layer for binary output (Tumor / Healthy)
For interpretability, Grad-CAM is applied to visualize activated regions indicating the tumor presence.
